    <p>About Me</p>




        I am a first-year Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student at IUBAT, passionate about exploring new technologies and expanding my knowledge in the ever-evolving world of technology. Born and raised in Uttara, Dhaka, I have always been curious about how things work and enjoy researching emerging trends and innovations in the tech space.

This portfolio showcases my early journey into the field of computer science, highlighting the skills and projects I've developed so far. I aim to continuously improve my abilities, work on real-world challenges, and push myself to think critically and creatively.

In the future, I hope to pursue my master's degree abroad to gain deeper insights and contribute to advancements in technology. My goal is to leverage the opportunities and experiences I gain in the field to create impactful solutions for global challenges.
